"""Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse.

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days[i,...,j],  and a number k, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where |i-reverse(i)| is evenly divisible by k. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range."""
